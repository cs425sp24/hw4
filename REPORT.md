# Homework 4: Report

## Introduction

> **Guideline:** Start this report by providing a high level introduction to consistent hashing while outlining the problem it resolves, preferably with an example for clarity. Include a brief historical note.  (hint: the term consistent hashing was introduced by David Karger in the 1990s) *[Limit: 3 to 4 paragraphs]*

## Consistent Hashing

> **Guideline:** Explain how consistent hashing works using examples and illustrations. Make sure to Highlight the differences between consistent hashing and traditional modulo-based hashing. Show what happens when a server (node) is added or removed. Do not delve into unnecessary detail, like virtual nodes. *[Limit: Keep your explanation within 4-5 paragraphs and include a few illustrations.]*

## Relevance in Distributed Systems

> **Guideline:** Explain why consistent hashing was introduced and what benefits it offers in building distributed software systems. Support your arguments with real-world examples. List some applications (examples of distributed systems that use consistent hashing). *[Limit: Keep this section to 4-5 paragraphs]*

## Challenges and Implementations

> **Guideline:** Describe some practical challenges or pitfalls of implementing consistent hashing in large-scale applications. Support your arguments with real-world examples. Follow up by explaining what "virtual nodes" are and how they address some of the challenges you've previously mentioned. Use examples and illustrations to explain how virtual nodes work, similar to how you described the workings of consistent hashing. *[Limit: Keep your explanation within 6-8 paragraphs and include a few illustrations.]*

## Conclusion

> **Guideline:** Conclude the report with a brief summary of the key points discussed. Highlight the importance of consistent hashing in distributed software systems. *[Limit to a few paragraphs]*

## References

> **Guidelines:** List any resources you used for research. This can include academic papers, textbooks, blog posts, YouTube videos, and even AI assistants like ChatGPT. *[Simply list the resources, there is no need for proper citation!]*
