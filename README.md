## Description

Consistent hashing is a strategy for efficiently routing requests among a changing set of web servers. This approach minimizes the need to rearrange a large number of requests when the number of servers changes. Although it is more of an implementation detail, its impact on system behavior, scalability, and resilience makes it an attractive subject for discussions on system design.
